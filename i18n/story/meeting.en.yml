  "Good morning, and thank you for attending in such high numbers this reunion of the association <em>Fanfare</em>."

  Rashomon pauses briefly, waiting for her audience – a lot more sparse than her polite, rehearsed speech may suggest – to grow silent.

  "Today, we need your help with three different projects."


  "First of all, because this is a year with thirteen full moons, the stocks of wolf’s bane that the association makes freely available to zoomorphs are at their lowest. Dejanire has suggested a forest trip to gather the necessary ingredients in order to produce more.

  Standing in a distant corner of the room, Dejanire waves and smiles nervously at the audience as she hears her name.


  "Second, a number of rare books have recently been donated to the town library, but it is suspected that some of them may be dangerous. Maharal would like some help to examine those books, so they can quickly be put on shelves."

  Leaning against the wall in a different corner, Maharal merely nods.


  "Finally, the solstice is near and the protective charms of the city are in need of maintenance – and perhaps more than just that – if they are to prevent harmful spirits from inviting themselves to the celebrations. I’ll be in charge of this task."


  Rashomon pauses again, then brings her presentation to an end :

  "That’s it for the overview. If you wish to participate in one of those projects or you have questions about it, I invite you to discuss it further with the person in charge. We’ll remain here at your disposal until about 10."


  An awkward silence ensues. No applause, no question, no reaction whatsoever. Each member of the audience is carefully watching the others – either hesitant, suspicious or jaded – waiting for someone else to stand out in this small, anonymous crowd.

  Ceto watches the three organizers with cynical amusement and a hint of jealousy.


  Rashomon’s presentation was labored, unimaginative, barely adequate. The efforts she put in it were hindered by a clear lack of spontaneity and lyrical eloquence, qualities that would have been necessary to fill the other volunteers with enthusiasm. She’s the class delegate, trying to look serious in front of her classmates but unable to make people listen to her attentively.

  Dejanire is the tall string bean so shy she tries to make herself look as small as possible. The girl you strive to be nice with even though her awkwardness makes you inwardly sigh.

  Maharal is the weird kid nobody really knows what to make of.


  In her heart of hearts, Ceto does not doubt that she could have a much better impression than any of those three if she had tried.

  But the current circumstances make it unwise to stand at the frontline, especially when one is a venomous, petrifying ophidian. Ceto has consequently resigned herself to playing a minor role in an association she helped found anew after the reorganization of the district.


  But she has many thoughts about the current situation.


  To make things even worse, the rest of the audience consists of confused newcomers and irregular attendants that are almost as helpless. She’ll have to set an example or this will take the entire morning.

  She suddenly rises above the hesitating volunteers, uncoiling vertically meter after meter, until her head is close to the ceiling and her shadow is cast over the small crowd. Then, having drawn the attention of everybody, she lowers herself to a more reasonable height and crawls toward one of the less than competent organizers.


  The task she finds most tempting is to settle in a library and read in peace. But she also has all the necessarily skills for the other two projects, and would certainly contribute to them more than any of the rookies could.

  Since she didn’t come here for her own enjoyment, maybe she should pick the project that she thinks needs her help the most, rather than make up her mind according to her mood.
