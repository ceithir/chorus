introduction: >-
  “Good morning, and thank you for attending in such high numbers this reunion of the association <em>Chorus</em>.”

  Rashomon pauses briefly, waiting for her audience – not nearly as numerous as her polite, rehearsed speech may suggest – to grow silent.

  “Today, we need your help with three different projects.”



  “First of all, because this is a year with thirteen full moons, the stocks of wolf’s bane that the association makes freely available to zoomorphs are at their lowest. Dejanire has suggested a forest trip to gather the necessary ingredients in order to produce more.”

  Standing in a distant corner of the room, Dejanire waves and smiles nervously at the audience as she hears her name.



  “Second, a number of rare books have recently been donated to the town library, but it is suspected that some of them may be dangerous. Maharal would like some help to examine those books, so they can quickly be put on shelves – or disposed of.”

  Leaning against the wall in a different corner, Maharal merely nods.



  “Finally, the solstice is near and the protective charms of the city are in need of maintenance – and perhaps more than just that – if they are to prevent harmful spirits from inviting themselves to the celebrations. I’ll be in charge of this task.”



  Rashomon pauses again, then brings her presentation to an end :

  “That’s it for the overview. If you wish to participate in one of those projects or you have questions about it, I invite you to discuss it further with the person in charge. We’ll remain here at your disposal until about 10.”



  An awkward silence ensues. No applause, no question, no reaction whatsoever. Each member of the audience is carefully watching the others – either hesitant, suspicious or jaded – waiting for someone else to stand out in this small, anonymous crowd.
ceto: >-
  Ceto watches the three organizers with cynical amusement and a hint of jealousy.



  Rashomon’s presentation was labored, unimaginative, barely adequate. The efforts she put in it were hindered by a clear lack of spontaneity and lyrical eloquence, qualities that would have been necessary to fill the other volunteers with enthusiasm. She’s the class delegate, trying to look serious in front of her classmates but unable to make people listen to her attentively.

  Dejanire is the tall and clumsy girl who’s so shy she tries to make herself look as small as possible. The one you strive to be nice with even though her awkwardness makes you inwardly sigh.

  Maharal is the weird kid nobody really knows what to make of.



  In her heart of hearts, Ceto does not doubt that she could have made a much better impression than any of those three if she had tried.

  But the current circumstances make it unwise to stand at the frontline, especially when one is a venomous, petrifying ophidian. Ceto has consequently resigned herself to playing a minor role in an association she helped found anew after the reorganization of the district.



  But she has many thoughts about the current situation.



  To make things even worse, the rest of the audience consists of confused newcomers and irregular attendants that are almost as helpless. She’ll have to set an example or this will take the entire morning.

  She suddenly rises above the hesitating volunteers, uncoiling vertically meter after meter, until her head is close to the ceiling and her shadow is cast over the small crowd. Then, having drawn the attention of everybody, she lowers herself to a more reasonable height and crawls toward one of the less than competent organizers.



  The task she finds most tempting is to settle in a library and read in peace. But she also has all the necessarily skills for the other two projects, and would certainly contribute to them more than any of the rookies could.

  Since she didn’t come here for her own enjoyment, maybe she should pick the project that she thinks needs her help the most, rather than make up her mind according to her mood.
alecto: >-
  Alecto has a hard time not fiddling with the collar of her tailor-made shirt. She’s definitely out of place here, in the midst of this strongly <em>earthbound</em> group. The four giants send shivers down her spine, especially the theatrical yet poorly dressed gorgon and the oni in a suit who looks like a bouncer. Aside from them, she’s also noticed a cheshire who must be at least thirty but dresses like a rich teen rebelling against authority, a slime barely capable of maintaining a humanoid shape, and even a Mask.



  Calm down. She’s not here to judge. She’s here to… To escape from the vague guilt that’s been gnawing at her for months now. But she won’t regain the strength to look at herself in a mirror after a merely symbolic act of presence.



  She takes a few moments more to gather her courage, smoothing without thinking feathers that already look perfect. Then she steps forward, walking with the confident gait of someone who’s been living since her childhood in a city with excruciatingly low ceilings, to the point where she feels just as comfortable on her legs than in the air.



  She’s not a wild bird and the forest doesn’t appeal to her. Still, the task seems important : a were who hasn’t taken his potion is not a pretty sight.

  The other two projects appear less essential, but at least she’ll be in her element and thus less likely to make a mistake.
carole: >-
  Carole’s not gonna lie to herself: she doesn’t expect this to be the most exciting day of her life. If she didn’t have to repair her reputation after being so imprudent in her latest videos, she’d be leaving right about now.



  Her plan, at least, seems sound. Putting aside the faceless degenerate (she should probably strive to call her a “Rlyehan” or a “Mask”, even when she’s just thinking to herself, because those things are supposedly telepaths), the lost souls surrounding her are the spitting images of the parents who accompany her youngest fans in conventions. Tired ladies trying to put on a brave face in a world that’s not theirs.



  If she helps these ones, she should logically score some points with the others, right?



  To get the most out of this, she had considered filming herself doing her charity work. But cameras really put people on edge these days, so she gave up on the idea. Recording herself describing her day, with all the necessary embellishments and theatrics, will have to do.



  She also refrains from showing off by performing her usual “grin without a cat” bit. This audience is unlikely to appreciate her quirkiness. Grudgingly, she puts one foot in front of the other and introduces herself in a lacklustre voice.

  All that remains is to pick the less annoying task of the three. Should she die of boredom covered in mud, dust or dirt?
katrina: >-
  Katrina adjusts the straps of her ventral harness to ensure that her head can see and hear without any hindrance. She’d like to put it on her neck, but doing so is strictly forbidden since the last batch of regulations on alternatives.



  Along with Dejanire, she’s one of the earliest members of the association and has seen its ups and its downs. Today is unlikely to be recorded among the great successes. If things keep going this way, there won’t be enough of them to form a basketball team.



  She’d love nothing more than to blame this hemorrhage on the new core members, in particular the painfully diplomatic Rashomon and the scornful Ceto. The first one treats her with exhausting circumspection, while the second barely even seems to notice her existence. But while she may not appreciate them, she knows all too well that those two aren’t responsible for the situation, and that the current decline is caused by external circumstances. Everything’s more complicated for everybody these days.



  And things are unlikely to improve. Rashomon and Dejanire are doing their best to enlist new members, but they’re exhausted. Maharal, Ceto and herself are poor recruiters, each for a different reason: one is too phlegmatic, another has too sharp a tongue, and as for herself, she’s notoriously unable to capture the attention of an audience even when she raises her voice.



  On the brighter side, the new members – most of whom will probably never return – seem to be drawn from a wide variety of backgrounds. Wider than usual, suggesting that the association is becoming known in circles it didn’t use to influence. The presence of a Rlyehan, even a minor one, is an especially encouraging sign. She’ll have to find an occasion to learn more about her.



  For now, several projects are still in need of hands. Used as she is to Rashomon’s doublespeak, she can guess that they all have serious stakes.

  Hanging around here and dealing with all sorts of things have instilled in her enough resourcefulness to be of use with any of the three tasks.

  Her being able to see ghosts and other spirits might suggest, in accordance with stereotypes, that she should take part in the restoration of the protective charms. In practice, this biological ability probably wouldn’t help her clean up old sanctuaries.
tekeli: >-
  Tekeli is pure stress under a thin, translucent membrane. Not literally, of course - her body is at least 95% water at all time - but it’s certainly how she feels. She’s this close to letting go and collapsing into a puddle that could then discreetly flow far from here.



  When she persuaded herself to come here, she thought it would be a modest social activity that would allow her to interact with other living beings in a non-virtual way while remaining a relatively anonymous part of a large group. But there are far fewer people than she was expecting, and it makes her feel exposed and conspicuous.



  People are beginning to move around her. The same instinct that was inciting her to flee now pushes her toward one of the organizers, seeking to disappear inside of a group – as small as it may be – rather than get noticed by remaining behind.

  For each of the three projects, she’s already imagined worst-case scenarios in which everything goes wrong because of her. The prospect of the library is especially panic-enducing, as a brief loss of concentration could be enough for her to engulf a fragile paper book.
camilla: >-
  Camilla immerses herself in the cloud of emotions that fills the room. Stress predominates, though it takes multiple forms : nervousness caused by the gazes of others, tickling doubt about the choices that led to this point, growing dread of failures to come. Those devouring, visceral emotions are surrounded by a more subtle mist of confusion and uncertainty.



  Such a muddle of fears is nothing unusual under the current circumstances. What’s fascinating, however, is how all these subjects rise above their negative feelings and, step by step, one by one, get involved in something that their instincts tell them to flee.

  This apparent incoherence is the reason why Camilla appreciates biologicals and biological-like beings so much. Magnificent chaos, capable of giving birth to unthought-of horrors and wonders.



  The preservation of such potential is worth getting her hands a little dirty.



  All the tasks seem equally uninteresting to her. Each one, however, should provide her with a special opportunity to mix with unusual beings in deliciously casual circumstances.

  Rashomon: a well-organized mind with partitioned emotions. Maharal: an iron will behind a veneer of good-naturedness. Dejanire: a mother both fierce and overprotective. Ceto: barbed yet fragile pride. Alecto: a conscience burdened with the silver coins of betrayal. Carole: the arrogance and vulnerability of a princess who only has until midnight. Katrina: adaptive fluidity undergoing crystallization. Tekeli: an indomitable evolution potential.



  So many intriguing possibilities. But groups have already formed while she was enjoying those cocktails, and the decision may have already been made for her.
rashomon: >-
  Relief floods through Rashomon. Things are getting underway without too many snags. Today’s volunteers are mingling, talking, asking questions, forming teams. Dejanire’s group is already about to leave, and her own will soon be ready.

  Though the controlled placidity of her face wouldn’t show it, she was briefly afraid that things would turn out terribly. But the newcomers already seem to be integrating. She even dares to hope that some of them will want and be able to come back.



  This moment of quiet is a good occasion for her to make a first assessment of the situation. Virtually no real anthropomorphs, as might be expected given their very low numbers in this district. Carole’s the closest thing to one. In fact, with the appropriate haircut and makeup, she would be physically indistinguishable from a human. Due to their quantum nature, cheshires however tend to be considered as half-rlyehans, and to be treated by all factions as weird, hybrid creatures.



  The presence of a pure rlyehan is a surprise and she doesn’t know how to interpret it. Camilla is however but a Mask, part of a casteless, decentralized, minor faction that’s flirted throughout history with all kinds of activities, communities and social classes.



  From that point of view, the anomaly would rather be Alecto and her obvious affiliation with the upper class. A world Rashomon also has strong ties to, though she doesn’t know this newcomer personally. She probably has a very well-paid job, for most of the aerials holding less important positions have left the city during the past year.



  Other non-humanoids are also disappearing. Dejanire is one of the last centaurs to live here, and Ceto is in a precarious situation. She was already standing out compared to other lamias (gorgons make up less than one percent of the total ophidian population), and seems even more out of place in a setting where very large-sized people are now but rare oddities.

  Of course, though she’s technically longer, she seems almost puny compared to the colossus that is Maharal. Then again, it’s on purpose that Maharal’s like this: as a golem, she’s able to modify her size and weight to a fairly large extent. Though her expressionless face never shows it, Rashomon’s convinced that she enjoys looking down at muscle-bound giants. Like Rashomon herself.

  Who’s indeed still not accustomed to not being the most ginormous one around (putting her own family aside). But she’s getting used to it. She’s always known how to adapt to circumstances, even bad ones.



  Katrina has also managed to adjust to the recent changes, as illustrated by her ingenious ventral contraption. However, she’s left exposed the well of darkness at the end of her neck, something that most dullahans would hide with a scarf or a kerchief. Rashomon suspects that it’s merely an oversight caused by tiredness rather than a deliberate attempt to stand out, but she’s not completely sure.



  Tekeli consequently wins the prize for most discreet and unassuming attendee. She’s a complete unknown. In the past, many members of the association used to be slimes, as might be expected considering they’re the historical founders of this district. However, they all left during the events that ended with Rashomon in charge.

  This newcomer doesn’t seem to have any ties to those former members, making her all the more mysterious.



  All in all, a chaotic alliance of contrasting personalities that will require compromises.

  Business as usual for Rashomon. But nevertheless exhausting.
