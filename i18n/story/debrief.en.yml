  Alecto collapses on her bed seconds after getting home. Her husband looks in from the doorway:

  “Difficult day at work?”

  “I wasn’t at work. It’s Sunday.”

  “Darling, you’re almost always at work on Sunday.”



  “Well, not this Sunday. I told you I’d be doing some volunteering today.”

  “And doing housework for the elderly is what put you in this state?”

  “It’s a bit more complicated than that. How are the kids?”



  “Fine. I had a video call with them this afternoon. We played their card game with flashy colors and they crushed me utterly. They’re wondering how much longer they’ll have to remain in the countryside with their grandparents.”

  “What did you tell them?”

  “What could I tell them? I was reassuring and vague. And speaking of that, you’re also evading questions. What happened to you?”



  “I was attacked by a hungry creature.”

  “What?”

  She tells him.



  “I… I didn’t expect such ordinary activities to present such dangers.”

  “Neither did I, believe me.”

  “And… Er… Did you report the problem to the supervising official? I don’t really know who’s in charge of associations, but this sort of things shouldn’t be tolerated. Some security protocols have clearly been ignored. Volunteer work shouldn’t mean endangering yourself.”



  “For the most part, I agree with you, darling. The organizers are at the end of their rope and they no longer realize what they’re asking of their volunteers.”

  “And yet you’re willing to let this go because…?”

  “Look out the window.”

  “I’m not sure I follow you.”

  “Just do it, please. You’ll understand.”



  Puzzled, he goes to the window. Before him rises the hill on which the world tree grows. At its feet are the ruins of the ancient medieval citadel, now a decorative part of a large park.



  A large park that is nearly empty, despite the fair weather and the magnificent view of the sun setting behind the world tree. Even though it’s wide open.

  To understand this stillness, one has to look a bit further, notice on one side the many roadblocks barring the streets leading to this district, and on the other side the many apartments with closed shutters and dying flowers.



  “The roundups are getting worse.”

  “They are. And remember that we’re supposed to be their allies, they don’t really have anything against us. What do you think will happen if I provide them with a pretext to target people they don’t like in the first place?”

  “Sorry. You’re right. An old reflex. For a moment there, I forgot…”

  “Lucky you.”
dejanire-intro: >-
  It’s already late in the night when Dejanire enters the premises of the association. A mere storehouse where old pieces of cardboard, yellowed newspapers, wooden planks, cans of paint and cans of glue are piled up. Everything necessary to cobble together a puppet theater, with the notable exception of tools.



  The other two aren’t here yet and Dejanire isn’t sure that they’ll actually turn up. She collapses in a corner, exhausted well beyond reason.
dejanire-failure: >-
  Dejanire sleeps very poorly, and not just because her improvised bed is uncomfortable. She knows that she has failed.

  She tried her absolute best, but she simply didn’t have enough raw material at her disposal. She considered going back to the forest to get more, but her exit authorization was only valid for a few hours on Sunday, and she didn’t manage to extend it or to obtain a new one.
maharal-failure: >-
  Feeling a hand against her shoulder, Dejanire suddenly opens her eyes.

  It’s Rashomon.



  Dejanire briefly feels relief… then her heart freezes again as she notices Rashomon’s expression.

  “Don’t tell me…”

  “Yes. They got Maharal.”
maharal-success: >-
  “Should we wake her up?”



  “No. She’s spent every night of the past week preparing decoctions until the early morning. Her body needs sleep.”

  “It makes me feel bad that I couldn’t help her.”



  “She was the only one with the necessary knowledge, and there certainly wasn’t enough time for her to also train someone to help her.”

  “I understand the reasoning behind that decision. But it doesn’t change how I feel.”



  With those words, Rashomon lets out a sound that’s somewhere in between a sigh, a grunt and an exclamation of rage, then slumps down on a pile of carboard sheets.

  Maharal looks at her with skepticism:



  “You also really need some sleep.”

  “I know. But Dej isn’t the only one the Security Department wishes to see work herself to death.”



  “Speaking of that, did things go well for you?”

  Rashomon pulls a laptop out of her bag, unlocks it and sets it down next to her.




  “If anything has happened, we should soon read about it.”

  “Then go to sleep. I’ll keep watch.”



  Rashomon almost answers that she has too much work left for that, but her exhaustion is such that she just cannot refuse the offer, whether she wants to or not.

  Grunting her acceptance, she lets herself sink into a state of half-consciousness.



  Maharal keeps her eyes on the screen. No news notification has appeared yet.
rashomon-success: >-
  Rashomon wakes up a few hours later, much to the distress of her own body.



  Seeing that she has only received ordinary administrative messages puts her in a good mood despite the brevity of her uncomfortable sleep.



  “Good. There hasn’t been any trouble, and that means we won’t get in trouble. I drove a hard bargain this week, to ensure that they’ll keep their word this time.”



  Mahara looks at her with skepticism.



  “I’m glad to learn that you had to move heaven and earth to make sure that we wouldn’t receive the visit of an armed squad, even in the absence of any incident.”

  “Sarcasm has never made things better,” replies Rashomon more sharply than she meant to, her nerves still frayed after her overly short rest.



  “What we do doesn’t seem to make things any better either,” says a bitter Dejanire, woken up by their raised voices.



  “We have to do our damnedest day and night simply to preserve the status quo. It doesn’t make sense,” she added.

  “I never said it was great. But we’re saving lives,” countered Rashomon.



  “For now.

  It can’t last.

  We’re working with less and less means, and more and more restrictions.

  It’s already a miracle that the serums I knocked together out of a few herbs haven’t killed anybody.”



  “They’re trying to trip us up in all possible ways, even the pettiest one. This morning, I once again had to fill several reams of additional paperwork.”

  “Well, what are you suggesting? That we start a fight and get everybody killed?”
werebeasts: >-
  The moon is full and, as usual, that means a curfew is imposed. Only the agents of the Security Department can be seen in the streets, in cars or on foot.



  An alarm is suddenly raised. Men and cars rush toward a specific location, surrounding a residential street entirely.

  Wearing only underwear, his fur ashen in the blinding glare of the headlights, the were appears to have escaped from a hospital. Drool is dripping from his ill-fitting muzzle and blood covers part of his right arm, next to the remains of a broken chain.



  Burst of gunfire rip through the night. Then the agents of the Security Department open an inquiry to determine the identity of the troublemaker and, consequently, who should be billed for cleaning up the street.
book-burning: >-
  The library is in a state of panic.

  The employees and a few brave regulars are hurriedly clearing out the shelves, throwing books in cardboard boxes that they then carry on the run to their personal vehicles.



  The vans of the Security Department are already at the corner of the street.

  The anonymous tip received half an hour ago was true, but it didn’t leave enough time.

  Only a tiny portion of the contents of the library – themselves quite modest – has been evacuated.



  Maharal drops the books she’s holding and stands straight.

  “I’ll hold them back. Save everything that can be saved.”

  Her declaration is met with a few nods, but nothing more. The situation is too serious for useless words.



  The librarian marches toward the main door, making a last-minute detour to stick her hand between the decorative plants and absorb every bit of their potting soil.

  It’s not clay, but any increase in her mass will serve her purpose.




  Outside, the approach of the armored vehicles has emptied the street.

  Everyone knows what’s about to happen.



  They’ll bar the way in front of the building and demand that all the books be handed over to them because of the danger they present, leaving the library a hollow shell. Again.



  They’re probably not aware of it yet, but the parking lot has another exit leading to a neighboring street.

  She just has to keep them busy enough that they realize the subterfuge as late as possible.



  Her first obstruction is a bureaucratic one.

  Request to see their warrant.

  Ask for further explanations, for the detail of the incidents.

  Then plead, beg, make them hesitate for a few more seconds.



  And when they decide – all too quickly – to resort to force and shove aside the big, whiny librarian barring their way… she hits them.



  Maharal isn’t a fighter. But her weight is considerable and, though the soldiers suffer little harm thanks to their state-of-the-art body armors, her punches manage to repel them for a little while. Because of her very nature, standard law enforcement weapons have little effect on her.



  Once the surprise has passed, the heavy weaponry the vans are equipped with puts a quick end to her pitiful resistance.
bad-reports: >-
  The first notification comes up at dawn. Then reports start coming one after another:



  A patrol car seems to have vanished after turning at the corner of a street.



  A high-ranking official disappeared from his apartment, leaving his clothes behind; the place was locked from the inside.



  Gunshots were heard in the night, agents are missing, and no clues – not even cartridge cases – were found to explain what happened.



  By mid-morning, reprisal measures have been decreed, and reports start detailing how people registered as spiritually potent are being rounded up.



  Then there’s an email specifically addressed to Rashomon.



  Her summons.
tekeli: >-
  Their eyes riveted to their screens, their fingers either resting on their keyboards or frantically typing, the back of their skulls covered by the pseudopods of the Migo interface hanging from the ceiling of the large room, the observers keep a close watch on the dreams of the ghetto. There’s more than a hundred of them; all are humans or biologically very close to humanity.

  In the early beginning, major rlyehans would themselves manage the surveillance and neutralization of people of low morality, on a case-by-case basis. As the livestock in their noble care grew, it became necessary to adopt a less individualized system, able to expand proportionally to the number of suspects.



  The sword of justice is now wielded by a different service, and Howard knows that it’s unwise to show too much interest in it. But information comes from this place, from these beings connected to the dream network thanks to an outstanding technological partnership. The dreams of the inhabitants of their assigned areas continuously flow through their heads. Everything that is deemed suspicious is scrupulously written down, and the resulting data is immediately processed on the lower floor.



  Unfortunately, Howard is in charge of said lower floor, and not of the marvel that he’s come here to admire. Alas, duty calls and he has to go back to the elevator.



  Whereas the Morpheus Room is strikingly modern and standardized, with its identical workstations and deliberately interchangeable employees, the Maat Room looks like a banal herd of penpushers, no different from what could be found in the previous, decadent administration. People of varied origins, brought here by chance, who spend their days working on archaic spreadsheets, cross-referencing unclear oneiric data with police and administrative files in order to identify undesirable elements with precision.



  Howard finds it somewhat disgusting to be in charge of all those uncivilized beings. If it was up to him, he wouldn’t mind replacing all of them with humans. Or, in a pinch, formians: they, at least, understand authority and the respect that he’s due. That’s why they’re on the right side of history, their side, in this war between order and anarchy.

  At least, these inferior beings are cheap, and savings should be made on things that don’t draw much attention from the public.



  Howard returns to his workstation. His computer allows him to observe what happens on the computers of his subordinates; he does so absent-mindedly, switching from one screen to another, looking for any sign of idleness.

  One of the slimes is working on an interesting case. Strong peaks of nihilism observed in individuals who have already come under investigation. If this is confirmed, he can definitely expect a bonus.



  Drat. False positives caused by the psychic interference of the solstice. What a pity.



  And, while her boss is busy being an idiot, operator Tekeli keeps inventing new ways of covering up the reckless dreams of Rashomon, Dejanire and the others.

    “Incidents have happened. That is contrary to our agreement.”

    Rashomon feels ill at ease in the small room, facing the representative of the Security Department under the eyes of cameras.



    “We’ve done more than the impossible, but our means are limited, and the problems we face are numerous and complex.”

    “I’m not interested in your excuses. If you can’t fulfill your commitments, then the deal is off.”



    Rashomon lets the storm pass, then replies in her most conciliatory tone:

    “I’m sure that we can still sort things out.”

    Or we wouldn’t be having this discussion, she refrains from adding.



    “I couldn’t say. It all depends on you. On what you’re ready to put on the table to regain our trust.”

    He doesn’t immediately make his demands known, preferring to let her stew for a while. Rashomon also remains silent. Anything she could offer right now would merely be added to what they truly want today.



    After a while, the man finally plays his hand:

    “Due to unfavorable circumstances, a shortage of certain goods is to be feared. We need people to inform and reassure the public, and dissuade those who might want to do something foolish.”

    Rashomon digests this new humiliation, not without difficulty.

    “I should be able to find a few volunteers for this task. But I’d like the association to remain out of it.”

    “I fully understand. Humanitarian work should remain separate from politics.”



    The grotesque irony of that reply, thrown in her face when she’s agreeing to do their dirty work rather than actually helping people, almost makes Rashomon lose her temper.



    Then her rational mind reminds her that the slightest fit of temper on her part would have unpleasant consequences for hundreds of people. And so she merely clenches her fists and grits her teeth while the man goes on with the rest of his demands.

    “Speaking of humanitarian works. Several cases of malignant fever have been detected in the northern district. Someone will have to dispense treatments, and perhaps vaccines, or we’ll have to quarantine the whole area to prevent an epidemy…”
  respite: >-
    At first, the only answer is a heavy silence.



    Then Dejanire speaks in a pleading voice:

    “I’m sure that there’s something that we’ve missed. An opportunity, a possibility. We can’t just keep putting out fires one by one while everything is burning around us.”

    “It’s not impossible that we’ll receive help from the outside once the geopolitical situation has changed.”

    “And until then?”



    “We keep doing everything we can. Until help comes.”
  hope: >-
    “Their strength comes from their alliance to the Rlyehans.”

    “Even in your dreams, you’re being watched.”

    “I dream about strangling them every night, so I’m not sure it works as well as they claim it does.”

    “Luck may have smiled on us so far. But their powers are real, and it’ll take more than tin foil hats to stop them.”



    “To oppose them, we need something of equal or greater strength.”

    “Are you thinking of the minor factions they’ve rejected, like the Masks? They’re not exactly the most powerful ones of the lot. And most people lump them in with the rest, and hate them almost equally.”



    “No, I’m thinking of the other powerful spiritual families. The ones that are even more enigmatic. The Celestials. The Chthonians. The Revenants.”

    “God, the Devil, Death, and their subjects. Add details according to your religion.”

    “They’ve always remained cautiously neutral, knowing that they didn’t have much to fear anyway. What would make them change their minds now?”

    “They’re closer to us than they’re ready to admit. We encounter more and more of them on our errands. It happens too often for it to be a mere coincidence. I don’t think they’re as indifferent to all this as they pretend to be.”



    Rashomon rises.

    “You’re leaving?”

    “Yes. I don’t want to hear anything more on this subject.”



    The other two glare at her.

    “No matter what happens, I’ll have to keep being overworked for a while, if only to avoid raising suspicion. The less I know, the less likely I am to give anything away.”



    There’s a burning gleam in her eyes, a tiny reflection of a repressed rage that’s been building up for months.

    “But believe me, when war breaks out, I’ll be in the frontline.”
