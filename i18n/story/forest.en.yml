introduction:
  part-1: >-
    It turns out that the forest picked by Dejanire isn’t a small suburban wood, but a vast nature reserve several hours away by car.

    She brings her small group there with her personal minibus, easily recognizable by the oversized compartment designed for its driver. During the ride, the passengers browse through the documentation prepared for them by the pharmacist. Aside from a wicker basket, each one has received a notebook filled with copies of encyclopedia articles, next to which are pasted dry specimens of the wanted flowers. The important parts of the articles are highlighted in neon colors.
  part-2: >-
    Along with those homemade herbariums, there are also a few tourist brochures explaining why those woods are such an ideal choice for a successful family trip. The attractive features they mention are the authenticity and the historical past of the area, where faery communities have existed since antiquity, the wild beauty of undergrowth untouched by civilization ("For your safety, hire a certified guide.") and a brand new sports course.



    The passengers read more or less attentively while the landscape passes by. It takes only half an hour for the city and its checkpoints to be replaced by empty countryside. Two more hours are necessary before tamed nature makes way for its wild cousin.

    The road finally starts climbing, the sun disappears behind a thick row of trees and, after a short distance in the shade, the vehicle stops on a parking lot in the middle of nowhere.
  part-3: >-
    Her legs stiff, Dejanire struggles a bit to get out of her seat. She then does a last minute check-up :

    “You both have a working GPS on your phone? You both get cell reception? You both have my number?”

    The two members of her tiny group nod. Even here, far from everything, that link with civilization still exists.



    "Good. Our time is limited, so we’re going to split up in order to cover more ground. We’ll meet here in four hours with everything we can gather. Call me immediately if you have the slightest problem. This area shouldn’t hold any danger, but it’s still very wild, so remain vigilant.

    The four plants we’re interested in today are aconite, arnica, belladonna and solanum nigrum.

    They’re all toxic and have a variety of unpleasant effects, so I advise you not to chew on them, but touching them is safe.

    None of them is a threatened species, so pick as many as you can."
  ceto: >-
    Ceto clicks her tongue loudly after checking her notebook. The peculiar sound brings instant silence inside the vehicule. A few awkward seconds go by before she says:

    “Neon highlighter? Really?”



    “The notebooks date back from the time when the association was focused on organizing discovery activities for kids,” replies Dejanire.

    Her icy tone conveys a clear message: "I don’t want to talk about this and you should drop the subject right about now."



    Faced with this sudden blizzard, Ceto decides - for once - that it would be best to put her biting cynicism aside. She answers meekly:

    “Sorry. I know that you cared about those activities.”



    “Don’t apologize. It’s not your fault we had to focus on other priorities.”



    Ceto winces. The bitterness hiding behind Dejanire’s mild words is intense. Close to boiling over, in fact. In the very near future, she could snap and do something stupid.

    And if even Dejanire, with her calm and poised nature, is now getting close to her breaking point, then the other two can’t be far from theirs.



    Ceto can’t imagine how such a scenario could possibly lead to a happy ending.



    After a while, to dispel the tension that she now perceives behind her, Dejanire adds with a strained smile:

    “Besides, I happen to really like neon colors.”
  camilla: >-
    Camilla immediately gets out of the minibus and starts soaking in the atmosphere of this unknown area, her mind tracking noises, smells and emotions down to their distant points of origin, beyond the cover of the trees. It’s essential that she understand the balance of power in this new environment as quickly as possible, before doing anything that might upset a bigwig.



    Her caution proves unnecessary. Neither Shub’ nor any other major power holds strong ties to this place. That’s probably due to the existence of a Seelie protectorate to the east. Though she doesn’t play such an important role in the game of dominions, Titania knows how to take advantage of rivalries and vassalages to ensure that her own lands are left in peace.

    This principality is however but a very minor one, an outpost of little importance. In fact, the western part of the woods has completely escaped from its control and returned to wildness ; it reeks of a large predator, blood and urine without the slightest hint of sentience.



    Aside from those two territories, nothing to report. A few other presences can vaguely be felt at the very edge of her senses, but their auras are too distant for her to locate them or learn more about their natures.
  carole: >-
    Carole hasn’t been paying much attention. It doesn’t take long for Dejanire to notice that she keeps casting glances all around.

    “Is there a problem?” she asks in a low voice.



    “We’re being watched.”



    Dejanire’s face grows stern :

    “Are you sure? We’re far from everything, and I’ve kept our exact destination a secret so we could work in peace.”



    “I’m positive. Look over there: if you pay close attention, you’ll notice very brief flashes of light.”

    Carole nods toward the south. Squinting in that direction, Dejanire gets the unpleasant feeling that something is moving very fast at the edge of her field of vision. It could be a real being or merely the product of her worried imagination.



    “I don’t care what you do, but I’m not getting any closer to whatever that is,” adds the multicolor-haired woman, all her senses on alert.

    Dejanire somberly takes note of her remark, and of her naked fear.



    Before weapons designed to harm them became commonplace, nothing could have scared the average cheshire. Their quantum nature ensured that the things and beings able to physically affect them against their will were limited to a handful of even weirder anomalies.

    That often made them annoyingly smug. But looking at the frightened face of her temporary assistant makes Dejanire greatly miss the arrogant grins they used to sport.
planning: >-
  Once done with explanations, Dejanire discusses with her tiny troop about which side of the forest each of them should search.

  The northern part of the forest seems to be the most frequented by hikers; it has wide paths and some garbage on the wayside.

  To the west, the woods are wilder, thicker and darker, with great trees hiding the sun; the flora has begun recapturing the narrow paths.

  To the east, the vegetation is more humid and the trees more sparse; there are small, easily flooded glades, and no path to speak of.

  The landscape to the south has been strongly shaped by civilization; its paths are straight, there are trail markers, and the outline of a sports course can clearly be seen.
split: "Now that they’ve all agreed on a strategy, Dejanire claps and they all leave in a different direction."
exploration:
  monster:
    1:
      default: >-
        Dejanire sets out at full gallop as soon as she hears the first scream, muffled as it is by the distance and the vegetation. She crashes through bushes and thickets, uncaring of the damage she causes to the flora.



        Her phone start buzzing, she picks up without slowing down.
    2:
      alecto: >-
        Over a background of loud noises, Alecto’s panicked voice can be heard:

        “Help! There’s a beast trying to eat me!”
      camilla: >-
        Camilla’s voice is as monotonous as usual, yet it seems somewhat more strained than usual:

        “Dejanire? A non-sentient, biological creature is attempting to harm me physically. Could you provide me with some help?”
      katrina: >-
        “Dej? It’s Kat. My body’s fighting against something. Sorry I can’t be more precise, my head has rolled to the ground and is stuck looking in the wrong direction.”
    3:
      default: >-
        Dejanire glances at the GPS telling her the location of the call and corrects her course, useless pieces of advice rushing out of her mouth :

        “I’m coming! Don’t move! Keep it away!”



        After what feels like eternity to both of them, Dejanire finally catches sight of Alecto standing between two trees and desperately trying to fight off a behir. One of the many dangerous creatures people know exist in the wild, have seen in pictures, movies and maybe even zoos, but never expect to encounter for real. Like a wolf, an ankheg or a bear.

        The snakelike lizard has coiled around its prey, half of its dozen legs firmly anchored in the ground, the rest trying to immobilize the torso and arms of its violently struggling meal.



        Half a second later, a hoof smashes against the creature’s head. A few more kicks force it to let go and the defeated beast, dropping between two large roots, hurries back to its underground lair.



        Dejanire immediately bends forward to help Alecto stand up.

        “Are you okay?”
    4:
      alecto: >-
        Alecto nods, though she’s white as a sheet :

        “I think so. I didn’t manage to take flight quite in time, but it couldn’t grab me correctly.”
      camilla: >-
        There’s a long silence before Camilla answers:

        “Yes.”



        Dejanire examines her, intrigued. Now that she’s paying more attention, she realizes that Camilla indeed has no wounds, and that even her clothes are completely intact.

        Out of politeness and prudence, she decides not to ask questions.
      katrina: >-
        Katrina picks her head up, sets it on her neck, blinks a few time, tests the joints of her arms and legs.

        “Seems so. More fear than harm.”
    5:
      default: >-
        “Good. Get on my back, I’ll carry you.”




        Once {{name}} is set up, Dejanire uses her phone to tell the other volunteer to return to the minibus, then sets off at a light trot.



        “I’m terribly sorry. I was convinced that the place held no danger. The girls and I never had any trouble on the previous occasions,” Dejanire says, stumbling over words.
    6:
      alecto: >-
        Alecto nods.

        “Think nothing of it. Accidents… happen.”



        Dejanire holds back a grimace. After a mishap like this, she’s almost certain that this potential generous donor will never come back. Another missed opportunity. She should have insisted on assigning a task that was perfectly safe.



        Then again, does such a thing even exist anymore?
      camilla: >-
        “The fault is mine. I’d detected the beast, but mistakenly thought that it could not threaten my physical integrity.”



        Sensing Dejanire’s puzzlement, Camilla adds :

        “The rules governing us are complex, even for ourselves. Errors of interpretation can happen.”
      katrina: >-
        “Did we organize outings in this area back in the day?”

        “Not here. But Maharal, Ceto and I have come several times since the reorganization.”



        “Sorry to say that, but the make-up of your reconnaissance team was biased. Given how big the three of you are, I don’t think that anything smaller than a T-Rex would take the risk to attack you.”

        “You’re probably right. We’re focused on so many things these days that we often fail to spot the obvious before it’s too late.”

        “I know. It’s not your fault. We just have to make do.”
  alecto:
    default: >-
      Alecto had thought that picking flowers would prove to be more enjoyable than shelving books or cleaning up old relics. But this dense forest, with its branches too low and numerous to allow proper flight, with its ground too treacherous for someone who doesn’t naturally favor walking, is really making her regret her decision.

      Moving slowly amidst the countless roots and stones, she wishes that time would go by faster and that this ordeal would finally end.
  camilla:
    default: >-
      Camilla reflects with puzzlement on the succession of choices that have led to her picking flowers by herself when she was looking for a social, community-focused experience.

      She expected a lot from the reactions of the others to a challenge – albeit a moderate one – that would take them out of their usual environment. The group splitting up unfortunately prevents her from tasting their emotions with the intensity she’d prefer.



      Being by nature almost incapable of questioning instructions, let alone of disobeying them, she nevertheless performs the uninteresting task with diligence.
    south: >-
      “I’m the door, I’m the key, I’m picking flowers.”



      Her face as expressionless as usual, Camilla unhurriedly turns toward the one who has just spoken. One of the peripheral presences that she couldn’t identify has decided to reveal itself.



      According to her main senses, it’s a pulsating, sentient ball of lighting. If she focuses on her sight, it’s an anthropomorph in a tracksuit, whose fur bristle due to her electrical aura.

      Raiju. In the great game, they’re barely even pawns.



      “Do we know each other?”

      “Not personally, but I have some yog-sothothesque friends. And as a rule, I get worried when I see them wandering around in these woods. What are you doing here?”

      “I’m picking flowers.”



      The newcomer sighs, takes a step forward, and in a sudden flash, crosses almost the entire distance separating her from Camilla.



      “Let’s do without ambiguous questions and cryptic answers, okay? I just want to know if I can finish my jogging in peace, or if things are about to go pear-shaped, with bigwigs turning up and general pandemonium.”

      The atmosphere becomes literally electric in response to her fit of temper, agitating the forest around her. The grass and leaves bend under a magnetic wind. Insects flee.



      Camilla remains perfectly unshaken. In her usual monotonous voice, she details the reasons for her presence, repeating almost to the letter the words of Rashomon and Dejanire.



      Her explanation is answered by a doubtful frown, followed by a shrug.

      “I don’t think I understand the great cosmic design behind all that, but okay, it does seem harmless.”

      A flash, movement almost as fast as light, and in an instant, the jogger is…



      … Still in the same place, with Camilla’s hand idly laying on her shoulder:

      “Time has been lost. Time must be repaid.”



      All her arrogance gone, the raiju agrees with a lump in her throat:

      “I help you pick flowers and we’re quits?”

      “That is acceptable.”
  carole:
    default: >-
      Carole idly picks a few flowers, her mind elsewhere.

      What is she titled her video "In the forest : I take on weres!" ?



      Rather hyperbolic, but she’s done a lot worse. A dynamic introduction with grandiose pictures related to cosmology and whatever ; hinting at gore and nasty, hairy creatures.

      Then, of course, she’ll talk about herself. Abundantly. Explain at very great length the reason why the things she did are so important.

      She’ll probably have to exaggerate the risks of taking a solitary stroll through the woods. It’ll make her look good and distract her audience from the real dangers of its everyday life.



      She won’t have to pretend much. Despite her quantum nature – sorry, bramble bush, but I’m not going to pick the version of myself who walked through you! – thinking about the things that could be lurking around here really puts her on edge.

      In fact, maybe she should tone it down a bit, and add a few stupid jokes to lower the tension. Her audience wants thrills, but would hate to really share her uneasiness. Pretend terror for kids, nothing more.



      And maybe she should start picking flowers at a faster pace, or word of mouth won’t do her reputation any good.
    east: >-
      Dans la clairière, au cœur d’un rond de sorcière, les fées dansent, invisibles aux yeux des créatures physiques.

      – Bonjour. Je cherche ces plantes-là. Vous sauriez où je pourrais les trouver ?

      Enfin, de la plupart des créatures physiques. Réprimant un soupir, la plus ancienne des fées fournit à l’intruse au livre grand ouvert les renseignements qu’elle désire, sachant pertinemment que c’est encore le moyen le plus rapide de s’en débarrasser.

      Céto n’est pas du genre à laisser son environnement lui dicter ce qu’elle doit faire, et c’est également vrai quand il s’agit de tracer son chemin à travers bois.


      Là où quelqu’un de moins imposant, ou n’ayant pas ses facilité à conserver son équilibre, ou pourvu d’une peau plus fragile, aurait choisi de contourner ce buisson de ronces, ce rocher moussu, ce fossé abrupt, elle continue tout droit, laissant derrière elle une large trace sinueuse caractéristique.


      N’ayant pas à se soucier du terrain, ni d’ailleurs de la faune qui se carapate à son approche, elle peut consacrer toute son attention à chercher les plantes demandées.
  dejanire:
    default: >-
      Dejanire slowly trots through the woods, just as nervous as she was feeling before. She tries to focus entirely on the task at hand, but the worries bouncing in her brain make it quite impossible.

      Yet it’s not the first time she’s come here looking for plants. Her experience and automatic reflexes compensate for her lack of attentiveness.
    south: >-
      Dejanire has already come to these woods several times. And, being high-strung by nature, she always pays close attention to weird details, no matter how small.



      Thus, it doesn’t take long for her to realize that something’s wrong. Burnt twigs. A faint smell of ozone. Fleeting flashes of light at the corner of her eyes. Something - or someone - stormy is in the vicinity.



      There’s no way of telling whether the thing or being means to watch her, to harm her or one of her assistants, or if it has absolutely nothing to do with them. Whatever the truth may be, there’s definitely something there, and it worries Dejanire so much that she has a very hard time focusing on the task at hand.
  katrina:
    default: >-
      Katrina can’t even remember the preceding occasion when the association organized an activity outside of the city. In fact, she’s not quite sure how much time has elapsed since she last left the city. Too much.



      Thus, she greatly enjoys this solitary stroll through the woods, far from concrete and camera, and all the more because it’s for a good cause.
    east: >-
      Inside a ring of mushrooms in the middle of a glade, fairies are dancing, invisible to the eyes of corporeal beings.



      “Hello. I’m looking for these plants. Do you know where I can find them?”



      Well, invisible to the eyes of most corporeal beings. Suppressing a sigh, the eldest of the fairies provides {{name}} with all the information she might desire, knowing it to be the quickest way to get rid of her.
  tekeli:
    default: >-
      As soon as she’s left the group, Tekeli extends a pseudopod and ingests the specimens of her herbarium one after the other. The dry flowers are swallowed inside her liquid body, carefully tasted, then spit back between the pages.



      Tekeli then gives up part of her humanoid appearance. Her limbs melt into a shapeless mass covered with hundreds of small protuberances, making her look like a weird half-human, half-slug creature.

      She then starts moving through the woods, slowly but surely, contracting her lower part, acutely perceiving the earth and the vegetation through her porous membrane, halting every time she notices one of the tastes she’s looking for.

      Some bits and pieces sink in deeper than they should, but the innate reflexes of her organism immediately expels them.



      In truth, the most difficult part of all this is ensuring that her upper half retains a humanoid shape. If she could do as she pleases, she’d leisurely move around as a large, flowing blob. But she needs hands covered by gloves in order to gather flowers without damaging them or soaking them through.
    west: >-
      Tekeli gets back on time, embarrassed, having lost her basket and holding but a handful of flowers.

      “I’m sorry, I had an accident.”



      “What happened?” asks Dejanire, worried.

      “Oh, a big lizard-snake attacked me. I slipped through its coils, but lost everything I’d gathered. I’m really sorry, I should have been more careful.”

      “You really don’t have to apologize for that. Now, tell me about that snake in more detail.”
