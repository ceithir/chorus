introduction: >-
  “Protection against spirits is a bit like electricity or running water. Everyone enjoys having it and has a vague idea of how it works, but very few can explain it in detail.

  So let’s review the basics, shall we?”



  Rashomon doesn’t have a video projector at her disposal. Otherwise, her pedagogical tone makes it clear that she would have brought some slides.



  “According to the Ayscough model, reality is divided into countless planes that repel each other like the identical poles of magnets. The fact that their number is astronomically large and that each one influences all the others has resulted in an almost stable structure, where all planes are separated by a certain distance.

  Almost stable because, in special circumstances, two planes can nevertheless brush against each other. When that happens, a being can force their way through to a reality other than their own, though it may harm them, as well as their plane of origin and their destination.



  In distant times, such things happened in an uncontrolled manner and it was possible to travel between planes unintentionally. Many major events of prehistory were caused by such phenomena.

  With the emergence of civilization, world trees and portals appeared. World trees increase the repulsive force, whereas portals greatly weaken it in specific places.

  The combination of those two technologies directs the flow of energy, making it nearly impossible to travel from one plane to another except via a portal.



  However, world trees are slow-growing and their range is quite limited: a few dozen kilometers at most, for the oldest among them. It is fortunately possible to extend their area of influence by using relay trees, created by grafting a world tree’s branch onto species with more dynamic growth.

  And that’s where things get complicated. Most of the relay trees planted throughout history reflect the period during which they were created, with its scientific knowledge, its superstitions and its religions. Their shapes are as varied as their levels of effectiveness.



  The goal of today’s operation is to check as many of the city’s relay trees as possible, with the help of pS test strips. If the result is bad, check whether it can be improved with a bit of cleaning up. If that’s not the case, make a note of the tree’s position so it can be communicated to the appropriate authorities.”

  Rashomon hands over packs of test strips. The user instructions are written on the back and can be summed up in a few words: stick the test strips directly on the tree, in several spots, and compare their color to the chart.
split: >-
  Rashomon unfolds an old paper map on which the locations of the city’s relay trees are shown with precision.

  “The likelihood of an incident is directly proportional to the number of people who spend time in an area with a defective relay tree. Five places are consequently priorities.

  The dormitory district, by far the most densely populated at night.

  The historic district, quite touristic and with diverse inhabitants.

  The residential suburb, highly populated as well.

  The shopping mall, packed during weekends.

  The business district, packed on weekdays.”
carole: >-
  “Rainbow Cat has been added to the black list.”



  Carole doesn’t show any immediate reaction to the tip just whispered by Rashomon. She keeps gathering brushes and trash bags as if nothing had happened.

  In a way, she feels relieved. When the hefty lady unsubtly told her – and her alone – to accompany her to a municipal storehouse where they would find useful equipment, she was expecting trouble to follow immediately. Instead, it merely turns out that she’ll be in trouble in the very short term.

  Rashomon is not fooled by her apparent lack of concern. The actress’s pupils widely dilated when she heard the information, but they’re now thin as slits. Behind her facade, she’s ready to fight tooth and nail for her survival.



  “What am I accused of?”

  “Trifles, along with a large helping of fabrication. I don’t think they really care about your activities.  You just had the misfortune to draw attention to yourself at a time when they were looking for semi-euclidians to target.”

  “I made a burbling propaganda video clip for those raths and this is how they repay me?”

  “You must have known that you were, at best, buying a little time at the cost of your conscience.”

  “And you’re behaving a whole lot better, I suppose?”



  Carole keeps speaking softly – out of instinctive caution, for no one else is near – but her voice is heavy-laden with rage and terror.

  “Seriously, do you realize the situation we’re in? We have to fix everything they break with the few pieces of tape they leave us, and we have to do it with a smile and pretend everything is perfectly normal?!”



  Rashomon decides to cut things short rather than engage in a pointless debate she knows she would lose. Every night in her bed, she has the very same debate against herself, and she never gets the upper hand.



  “What matters is that you still have a little bit of time. Not much. A few days at best, less if you do anything that would draw their attention. Use that time to plan your escape.”

  “Why shouldn’t I leave today?”

  “Because I have no doubt that our small group is being watched and your absence would be discovered much too quickly.”

  “What a haighabrained plan…”



  In truth, the warning is a stroke of extreme luck for Carole. If she hadn’t been here today or if Rashomon – after much hesitation – hadn’t recognized her, she wouldn’t have been tipped, for every message she receives on her phone or computer are under strict surveillance. Rashomon doesn’t point that out, however.

  Her good luck stops here. There’s no guarantee that Carole will manage to get away, far from it. Rashomon wishes she could do more to help her, though this short conversation is already quite risky. In fact, from a strictly logical point of view, she shouldn’t have said anything: she’s putting many lives at risk in order to save a single one.



  But Rashomon is sick and tired of cold-blooded calculations involving sentient lives. She’s a civil servant and a political animal, but exhaustion is eating away at the shell covering her inner feelings. If she keeps going this way, people may even start believing that she has a heart.



  Well, assuming there’s anyone left to mourn her after her self-control finally snaps.
tekeli: >-
  Unlike most of the other volunteers, who only recently had to move to this side of the city, Tekeli has spent her entire life in the overpopulated apartment blocks at the edge of the city. She knows every nook and cranny, as well as the people who can prove to be useful and the people who shouldn’t be approached.

  Her experience should allow her to take care of the relay trees more quickly and efficiently than her friends for the day.
alecto: >-
  Unlike her teammates, Alecto won’t have to waste time in public transportation and at checkpoints, as she has both a motorcycle and a category 2 priority pass.

  Merely waving that piece of plastic, with its silicon chip containing her biometric information, allows her to bypass waiting lines and cross security checkpoints without anyone searching her belongings. Where others have to wait for long minutes, it only takes her a few seconds, the time necessary for an agent to check her pass with their scanner.



  Usually.



  Once, there was a connection problem and the device didn’t respond immediately with a positive beep. The wait felt terribly long to Alecto.

  It did serve as a wake-up call. Rather than a temporary incident, the loss of her fragile privilege could have been decided by her employer withour her knowing. Indeed, the day she’ll stop proving useful, they probably won’t bother warning her in advance.



  Still, as long as she diplomatically lets her boss take credit for some of her achievements, he has no reason to want her gone, on the contrary. Considering that he decided last week to have her handle a matter he obviously deems very important, it seems likely that he wishes to carry on with this fruitful cooperation for as long as possible.

  At least, as long as she does his job for him and manages to find funds for the increasingly demented projects launched by the Security Department. Why do they need so many helicopters when there are barely any aerials left in the city?



  Focus. It’s the weekend. And you’re trying to have some degree of morality today.

      “There it is.”

      The caretaker has led {{name}} to something that looks like a maritime container, at the bottom of one of the high-rise blocks.

      It’s a large iron cube, covered in graffitis, with a single door held shut by an imposing padlock.



      “The tree’s inside. They boxed it in about six months ago, saying that there had been damages and that it should be better protected.”

      “Do you have the key?”

      “No. I don’t even know who has it. Ah, and there’s an alarm, so don’t get any ideas.”
    carole: >-
      “I need to be on the other side of this door. But if I go to the other side, the other side will be this side. So, in a way, I’m already on the other side.”

      The caretaker, having already heard about the absurdities of shrewding logic, lets Carole spout her nonsense.

      “And in fact, I am on the other side.”



      And so she is.
    tekeli: >-
      The door isn’t airtight, far from it. It’s child’s play for Tekely to flow through the gap between its bottom and the ground, and assume a humanoid form again on the other side.
    success: >-
      The relay tree – originally a mere plane tree – probably was never much to look at.



      But its current state is truly pitiful: it barely receives a bit of sunlight through the wire-mesh ceiling and it’s infected by fungi, that grow quickly in the humid atmosphere of the cage.




      The test strips unsurprisingly reveal that the level of protection generated by the tree is very mediocre, well below what it should be.



      {{name}} exits the metal cube the same way she entered it.

      “Is there no way to get the tree out of there? It’s really going to die if it remains inside for much longer.”

      “Don’t you think I know that? We tried to get rid of this freaking box without having to be told.”



      “But it turns out the Security Department doesn’t like it when people reject their brilliant ideas.

      So you should look for a different approach, unless you want both of us to be taken to the station.”



      After a call to Rashomon, it is decided that {{name}} will use rags soaked with fungicide to weaken the parasites covering the tree.

      She’ll also till the ground with her hands as best she can.

      It’s not much, but still better than nothing, and it’ll buy time

      In spite of her best efforts, {{name}} does not find a way around this problem and leaves defeated.
  old:
    intro: >-
      To understand this district, one must go back to its origins – and thus to the city’s origins – two millenia ago.

      It was here that the lords of that time planted the seed of the world tree that would ensure their peace of mind. And so it was for centuries: the city grew slowly, along with its vegetable protector, and ended up becoming the nerve center of the region.

      Relay trees already existed at the time, but had more to do with amateurish tinkering than with actual science. Each religion and guild kept secret its knowledge of the subject, even though said knowledge was often less than useful.



      Scientific progress replaced mysticism with facts and the understanding of the phenomenon improved. Things grew better. And then they grew worse, when the local lord realized that he could sell access to his world tree: each relay tree would have to be authorized and a fee would have to be paid.

      A political quarrel ensued and the city found itself with two world trees: the old one, in this district, and a young shoot in what is nowadays the city center. They were under the control of two rival noble families, each striving against the other to establish dominance.

      The conflict ended with the destruction of this district’s world tree, and with all the important administrative buildings moving to their current locations.



      This district was left isolated and impoverish, and even became independent from the main city for a while. During the last century, it was rehabilitated as a tourist site. And of course, it still bears the traces of all those changes, as mementos of this peculiar history live on to this day.

      One of them was created because the new local lord had forbidden to replace the destroyed world tree with a relay tree. An illegal relay tree was thus planted in secret at the bottom of a disused well; to compensate for the difficult conditions, it was created out of a highly resistant plant species.



      That same tree still protects the district nowadays. There’s even a sign mentioning its existence. And a grate, to make sure that people don’t fall down the well.

      The local caretaker opens the grate for {{name}}.

      “Good luck. Nobody has gone down there for years. Too dangerous.”

      The rusty rungs that disappear into the darkness below certainly don’t inspire a lot of trust. Some of them even appear to be missing.
    alecto: >-
      Living in urban surroundings, Alecto has a lot of practice taking off and landing almost vertically, as well as gliding in low and narrow spaces.

      She begins a controlled fall down the well, keeping the rungs close at hand, then flies up again by flapping her wings. Once reassured that she has room enough to maneuver, she glides down to the bottom.
    tekeli: >-
      Tekeli lowers a long pseudopod to the nearest rung, augmenting the adhesiveness of her limb to ensure that it can get a strong grip on its irregular surface. Then she reaches for the next one and keeps going down, slowly and cautiously.

      By stretching her abilities, she could probably cling to the wall itself and do without the ladder entirely. But she has no reason to exhaust herself uselessly, something that would bring back unpleasant memories of gym class.
    success: >-
      The bottom of the well has been overrun by a misshapen plant, a snarl of roots and bent branches that has grown as best it could in this narrow space in order to maximize the amount of sunlight and water it receives.

      It’s this district’s homemade relay tree and it’s surprisingly tough, though not pretty.



      However, many things have been thrown through the well’s grate over the past decade, and the plant is now covered with coins, crushed cans, cigarette butts and the like, reducing its effectiveness.

      {{name}} goes back up to fetch cleaning tools and trash bags, then a thorough cleanup begins.

  rich: >-
    The residential suburb is a series of small detached houses, all built on the same model and differentiated only by minor details: the color of the shutters, the appearance of the entrance gate, the presence of flowers under the windows.

    The relay tree is a stout chestnut tree in the middle of a traffic circle. Nobody seems to take care of it, but nobody bothers it either, and it seems to be doing fairly well.

    The pS test strips confirm that impression, revealing its level of protection to be “very good”, which is more than enough.
  bank:
    default: >-
      Though the business district remains thought of as a recent one, it was in fact created several decades ago, and so was its relay tree.



      At the time, unified standards regarding relay trees had been formulated, but were not yet strictly implemented, and it was fashionable to hide those protections, as they were widely expected to become obsolete and be replaced by more modern alternatives in the near future.




      Thus the tree has been rather crudely integrated into one of the artistic compositions that decorate the place: it’s a willow shaped and trimmed to look like an angelic figure. In theory at least. The general opinion is that it looks fairly creepy when the evening falls.



      Aside from dubious esthetic choices, the tree is well cared for, like everything in this district. No matter where {{name}} sticks them, the test strips show a bright green color.
    rashomon: >-
      “Now that’s top-quality anger. Sure you aren’t a belial?”

      Rashomon doesn’t have to lower her eyes to look at the person addressing her, for she’s levitating two full meters above the ground, nonchalantly reclining in the air. She looks like a translucent oni in a tight-fitting golden dress. However, Rashomon knows quite well that she only shows what she wants to show, not what she truly is.



      “I don’t know my family tree very well, so it’s possible. Nice to meet you, my name is Rashomon and…”

      “Yeah, yeah, I didn’t ask for your life story. Are you going to start breaking things or aren’t you?”

      “I’m not.”

      “Seriously? That’s a waste. Nice anger like this should be put to good use.”


      Indifferent to such digs, Rashomon tries to switch to a more interesting subject:

      “You’re a demonic, aren’t you? Probably a mammon, in this district. Do you…”

      “No.”

      And she vanishes in a burst of glitter.



      That was to be expected. Pure demonics are not known for their patience. If it’s neither food, nor danger, nor a source of amusement, it doesn’t interest them.

      Still, they are just as powerful as they are fickle. And quite difficult to eradicate. Rashomon wonders what the Security Department would think if it learned that such a being is hiding in the heart of the most highly protected district in the entire city.
    spirit: >-
      Technically speaking, the relay tree is doing its job: it does prevent spirits from entering this area.

      But imposing a humanoid shape on a plant loaded with spiritual energy in a pseudo-religious environment is not an very smart idea. In fact, it’s an excellent recipe for creating or inviting in extremely wily spirits.



      The mammon is invisible to most eyes and has learned to hide from others inside the sculpted tree that birthed it. But the solstice is so near that she’s brimming with energy, and careful examination ends up revealing her presence.



      As soon as she’s detected, she appears in her full horned glory, ready for a fight. But a glance at {{name}} is enough to convince her to play it safe.

      “All right. If you meant to exorcize me, I guess you would have already done it. So what will it take for you to forget that you saw me?”



      After a purely perfunctory negotiation, the mammon agrees to lie low on the day of the solstice, and to make sure that no other spirit takes advantage of it to enter her territory. The latter is something that she certainly meant to do anyway, but the former makes her sulk a little bit.
  supermarket:

      The relay tree was created at the same time as the shopping mall, half a century ago. Both of them still fare quite well.

      The tree stands at the end of the central aisle, in a decorative area full of vegetation and statues, protected by brightly colored tape and a “Do not touch” sign. A quick examination doesn’t reveal anything out of the ordinary, and the cleaning operatives confirm that it’s perfectly healthy.
    carole: >-
      “Rainbow Cat?”

      Carole looks at the person who just addressed her. A group of teenagers has come close and is staring at her with wide eyes.



      She hated situations like this even when she didn’t yet have a vorpal sword hanging over her head. She already spends more than twelve hours a day playing the clown in front of her cam; is it asking too much to expect people to leave her in peace the rest of the time?

      Right here, right now, she feels like sending them packing with a rude gesture.



      But since it’s not something she would do in normal circumstances, she’ll have to maintain her facade, as if everything was just fine, as if she wasn’t dying inside.



      Her usual smile comes to her lips and, with a practiced gesture, she runs her hand through her brown hair, turning it into a rainbow mane.

      “That’s me.”

      Smile, shake hands, smile, give short and evasive answers to all questions, smile, sign a few bags, smile, and – at the right moment – disappear mysteriously, leaving only a calling card behind.
